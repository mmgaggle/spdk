 * rados-nkvx: the sandboxed near-data Exec executor (TB1 walking skeleton).
 *
 * This is the NEW local-execution path mandated by ADR-0009: KV Exec runs in an
 * in-process sandboxed executor, NOT as a Ceph object-class in the OSD. The
 * existing rados_read_op_exec/cls path in kvdev_rados.c is deliberately left
 * untouched and is being phased out.
 *
 * TB1 scope (intentionally thin):
 *   - A CPU-issued KV Exec selects a hardcoded built-in module by op-ID (via a
 *     "nkvx:" binding prefix the NVMf allowlist forwards verbatim).
 *   - The object is cold-filled from RADOS via plain librados aio (the same
 *     harvest-on-the-SPDK-thread poller pattern the rest of the kvdev uses).
 *   - The module runs OFF the SPDK reactor thread on a dedicated worker, with
 *     async completion handed back to the originating SPDK thread. This
 *     off-reactor hand-off is the load-bearing piece (rados-nkvx-plan §3.2:
 *     "Off-reactor execution ... harder than the sandbox").
 *
 * Explicitly OUT of TB1 scope (later tracer bullets): allowlist/sidecar, caps
 * (fuel/epoch/memory), content-addressed raw-bdev cache, hash-verify,
 * warm-instance reuse, two-tier CRUSH routing.
 *
 * wasmtime SEAM: see kvdev_rados_nkvx_run_module(). TB1 runs a trivial built-in
 * in C because wasmtime is not yet linked into the SPDK build; the seam is
 * marked so TB2 can swap in a real (tiny) wasmtime invocation without disturbing
 * the off-reactor dispatch proven here.

 * trampoline whose unwind leaves Memcheck-"uninitialised" bytes in stack slots
 * the off-reactor worker frames then legitimately reuse. Reading them is a

 * frame re-reads the reused slot after the wasm call returns. VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_
