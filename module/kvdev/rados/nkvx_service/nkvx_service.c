 * rados-nkvx standalone executor service — Slice C2 skeleton.
 *
 * A non-SPDK Mercury TARGET that listens for the inter-tier `nkvx_exec` RPC
 * (the contract frozen in Slice C3, ../nkvx_exec_rpc.h) coming from the front
 * (rados-nkv). See docs/design/slice-c-exec-rpc-mercury.md §2/§4.
 *
 * SCOPE (C2): the service skeleton ONLY — Mercury init (listen), register the
 * RPC, a manual HG_Progress/HG_Trigger progress loop, and self-address publish
 * (design OQ-8: a file on the testbed). The RPC handler is a STUB: it decodes a
 * well-formed request and replies SPDK_KVDEV_IO_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. The real
 * fetch -> sha256-verify -> wasmtime-run -> TB4-cache pipeline (reusing the
 * existing off-reactor kvdev_rados_nkvx*.c) lands in Slice C5; this proves the
 * transport + contract round-trip end to end first.
 *
 * Build under -std=gnu11 (load-bearing for the C3 wire-status static-asserts;
 * see ../nkvx_exec_rpc.c). Built by the standalone Makefile in this directory,
 * NOT the SPDK build graph (the executor is non-SPDK by design, design §1).
 *
 * Dev rung: na+sm:// (or ofi+tcp://) loopback. Acceptance rung: ofi+verbs over
 * the E810 DAC (Slice C8) — same code, swap the --listen provider string.

 *
 *   Get_input
 *     -> [large input] HG_Bulk_transfer(PULL) ──cb──> on_input_pulled

 * ALL of it via the proc HG_FREE path — so the handler frees only the LOCAL bulk
