 * rados-nkvx executor backend (Slice C5a.1): the librados cold-fill + module run
 * that the standalone executor service (nkvx_service.c) invokes from its Mercury
 * handler. This is the "object/cache path on the executor" the design relocates
 * here (docs/design/slice-c-exec-rpc-mercury.md §2): the executor owns its own
 * librados (cold path only, ADR-0009), resolves oid=hex(key), cold-fills the
 * object, and runs the module — the front never ships object bytes.
 *
 * C5a.1 scope: the BUILT-IN modules (bytecount/identity) over a synchronous
 * librados cold-fill, replacing the C2 NOT_SUPPORTED stub for the built-in
 * route. Real-wasm (module fetch + sha256 verify + run_cached cold-fill-once +
 * the TB4 cache) is C5a.2; cross-hop invalidation is C5b.

 *   - result_len: the TRUE result length (truncation semantics, ADR-0014 /
 *                 design §1.2) — always the full length the module produced,
 *                 even when only result_len <= osize bytes were materialized.
 *   - buf      : the delivered bytes — min(result_len, osize) of them — freshly
 *                malloc'd (NULL when nothing is delivered). Caller frees via
 *                nkvx_exec_result_free().
 *   - buf_len  : number of valid bytes at buf == min(result_len, osize).
 *
 * Delivery rule the handler applies (design §1.3): buf_len <= NKVX_INLINE_MAX
 * (or no result_sink) -> inline in the response; otherwise PUSH buf into the
 * front's WRITE-registered result_sink and respond with an empty inline body.

 * Per-request input is NOT consumed by any current execution path. The built-in

 * oid=hex(key); they never read in->input_inline or in->input_len. Input is
 * reserved in the contract — it is delivered to this tier (inline, or PULLed by
 * the handler when in->input_len > NKVX_INLINE_MAX) — but no current module
 * reads it. Wiring input into execution is future work (a separate bead).
 *
 * Always returns 0 with the outcome carried in res->status (mapped to a tenant
 * CQE on the front); a negative return is reserved for an internal contract
 * violation (res left zeroed/FAILED).
