 * MR / hg_bulk handle cache (Slice C7.2, design §4.3 / OQ-7).
 *
 * Registering a bulk handle over a 64 MiB DPTR is not free: on the verbs
 * provider HG_Bulk_create -> ibv_reg_mr pins and page-walks ~16K pages on EVERY
 * large Exec — a perf cliff. The common case is a RECURRING tenant DPTR (SPDK
 * pool-recycles the DMA buffer), so a handle keyed by (addr,len,flags) is reused
 * across Execs instead of re-registered. Nil benefit on sm/tcp; the win is verbs.
 *
 * Bounded LRU: a fixed per-front slot array, evicting the least-recently-used
 * UNREFERENCED entry. nkvx_front is per reactor/channel and single-threaded (see
 * nkvx_front_client.h), so no locking. `refs` guards an in-flight handle from
 * eviction; a handle stays registered after refs hits 0 so the next reuse HITs.
 * If every slot is referenced at once (>= NKVX_BULK_CACHE_SLOTS concurrent
 * distinct DPTRs), the overflow handle is created uncached and freed on release.
 *
 * INVALIDATION CAVEAT (OQ-7, ties to C6 teardown): the cache keys on address and
 * cannot observe a tenant DPTR being freed/remapped. It relies on SPDK DMA
 * buffers being stable (pool-recycled, same mapping), which holds at the tenant
 * edge. Explicit invalidation-on-free is deferred (OQ-7 / C6a).
