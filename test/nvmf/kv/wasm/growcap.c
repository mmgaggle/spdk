/*
 * NKVX wasm test module: growcap (spdk-90x — store-limiter cap proof).
 *
 * Unlike overalloc (which grows UNBOUNDED until something stops it), growcap
 * grows a FIXED, BOUNDED number of pages and then returns SUCCESS. This makes it
 * a clean fail-before/after probe for the wasmtime store memory LIMITER on the
 * NON-custom-memory plain run() path:
 *
 *   - WITH a tight store limiter (cap < the bounded target), one of the
 *     memory.grow calls FAILS (returns (unsigned)-1) before the target is
 *     reached; the module then deliberately traps (unreachable). The host
 *     surfaces a contained failure — the limiter is load-bearing.
 *   - WITHOUT the limiter the bounded grows all SUCCEED and the module returns
 *     SUCCESS (8-byte result). Because the growth is BOUNDED (GROW_PAGES), this
 *     never OOMs the target even with the cap disabled — so the fail-before is
 *     safe to run.
 *
 * GROW_PAGES * 64 KiB = the bounded ceiling (here 1024 pages = 64 MiB). A test
 * cap of ~1 MiB (16 pages) is far below it, so the grow fails fast under the cap.
 *
 * ABI matches the other modules: growcap(i32 obj_off, i32 obj_len) -> i32 res_len.
