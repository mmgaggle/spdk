/*
 * NKVX wasm test module: slackwrite (sandbox-semantics regression, spdk-ii0 D1).
 *
 * Declares a single 64 KiB page of linear memory (--initial-memory=65536) and
 * writes one byte at offset 70000 -- PAST its own declared page (valid offsets
 * 0..65535), but WITHIN a larger (2-page) object backing the zero-copy
 * MemoryCreator may have allocated for a big object.
 *
 * This is the D1 defect: before the fix the custom linear memory reported the
 * FULL object backing as its size, so this write into the "slack" between the
 * module's declared minimum and the larger backing did NOT trap (an escape of
 * the module's declared bounds, contained to the object buffer but a violation
 * of normal-linear-memory semantics). After the fix the reported size is capped
 * to the module's declared, page-rounded minimum (one page), so this access is
 * out of bounds and MUST trap -> contained (FAILED/ABORTED).
 *
 * The companion in-bounds proof (a write/read below 65536 still succeeds and is
 * still zero-copy) is covered by checksum.wasm in the same test.
 *
 * Build (requires clang with the wasm32 target) -- see README.md:
 *   clang --target=wasm32 -nostdlib -O2 \
 *     -Wl,--no-entry -Wl,--export=slackwrite \
 *     -Wl,--initial-memory=65536 -Wl,--export-memory \
 *     -o slackwrite.wasm slackwrite.c
