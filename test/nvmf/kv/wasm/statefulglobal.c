/*
 * NKVX wasm test module: statefulglobal (spdk-yc1 — warm-instance state isolation).
 *
 * Deliberately STATEFUL: it keeps a mutable module-level counter and, each run,
 * reports the value it observed BEFORE incrementing it. The counter lives in a
 * place that persists across runs ONLY if the warm-instance state is reused:
 *
 *   - `g_counter` is a mutable global with a declared init of 0. Re-instantiating
 *     the module (the spdk-yc1 reset) resets it to 0 every run; reusing the same
 *     instance across runs would let run 2 observe run 1's increment.
 *
 * Contract (same ABI as the other modules):
 *   - statefulglobal(i32 obj_off, i32 obj_len) -> i32 result_len (== 8)
 *   - writes the OBSERVED counter value (before increment) as a little-endian u64
 *     at RES_OFF, then increments the counter, and returns 8.
 *
 * Proof: run twice warm against the same (module,object).
 *   - WITH per-Exec re-instantiation (isolation): both runs observe 0.
 *   - WITHOUT (instance reused): run 1 observes 0, run 2 observes 1 (leak).
