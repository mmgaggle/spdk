/*
 * NKVX wasm test module: pageprobe (sandbox-semantics regression, spdk-ii0 D1).
 *
 * Companion to slackwrite.c. Declares a single 64 KiB page of linear memory and
 * does an IN-BOUNDS write at offset 1000 (well within its own declared page),
 * then writes a recognizable marker u64 at the result offset and returns 8.
 *
 * Run against a LARGER (2-page) object backing, this proves that capping the
 * reported memory size to the module's declared minimum (spdk-ii0 D1) does NOT
 * break legitimate in-bounds access and does NOT break zero-copy: the write
 * succeeds and the module's linear memory still ALIASES the cached object buffer
 * (mem_base == cache_base). It is the in-bounds half of the D1 CASE-A proof;
 * slackwrite.wasm is the out-of-bounds (must-trap) half.
 *
 * Build (requires clang with the wasm32 target) -- see README.md:
 *   clang --target=wasm32 -nostdlib -O2 \
 *     -Wl,--no-entry -Wl,--export=pageprobe \
 *     -Wl,--initial-memory=65536 -Wl,--export-memory \
 *     -o pageprobe.wasm pageprobe.c
